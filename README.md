### Future Enhancements:

🔹 🚀 Real-Time Cube Scanning with OpenCV: CubeTutor is gearing up for a major upgrade! In the future, you can expect the integration of OpenCV, enabling the program to capture your physical Rubik's Cube directly into the virtual environment. Watch as your real-world moves translate into the digital realm!

🔹 🔍 Algorithm Suggestions at Your Fingertips: CubeTutor gets even smarter! By scanning specific PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) or OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer) configurations, CubeTutor will tap into its extensive database. It will then fetch and present you with a curated selection of algorithms sourced from leading cube algorithm websites. These algorithms will be tailored to your current cube state, providing you with multiple solving options.

*CubeTutor is not just a tutor; it's your personal Rubik's Cube mentor, continuously evolving to provide you with the best learning and solving experience possible.* 🌟🧩
